# Educational NotQuiteJava compiler

Educational compiler translating a subset of the Java Programming Language, NotQuiteJava (NQJ), into the LLVM language. It supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms such as inheritance, method overriding, and more. For further details, please refer to the documentation.

The template was kindly provided by Albert Schimpf (University of Kaiserslautern) as part of the "Compilers and Language-Processing Tools" lecture. After the end of the examination grading, we were kindly granted the right to freely redistribute the related material. As part of the examination, OOP paradigms were asked to be implemented into the pre-existing compiler infrastructure, and the necessary changes were to be documented.

# Known defects
* Subtype compatibility is not considered for method overriding.
