# Exercise 3: Name and Type Analysis

## Representing Types
```java
Type =          // a type is either void or a proper type
   | VoidType
   | ProperType

ProperType =    // a proper type is eiher a reference type or a value type
   | ReferenceType
   | ValueType

ValueType =     // there are two value types (int and boolean)
  | IntType
  | BooleanType

ReferenceType =
  | ArrayType // a reference type is either an array type
  | NullType  // or null

ArrayType = // an array type has an element type (of proper type)
  {elementType}
```
As seen above, we have an abstract superclass [Type](./src/main/java/analysis/types/Type.java).
The only thing all types have in common is a name. Therefore, **Type** offers `getName()`
which must be implemented by all types. **Type** does not contain the name as field since some types
return a constant name (e.g. *void*). Furthermore, all types must implement `isSubtypeOf()` which
is used to check for type compatibility.

Each type is represented by exactly one object, to allow comparison via `==`.
The following types are represented by singletons accessible via `<typename>.INSTANCE`:

- [VoidType](./src/main/java/analysis/types/VoidType.java)
- [IntType](./src/main/java/analysis/types/IntType.java)
- [BooleanType](./src/main/java/analysis/types/BooleanType.java)
- [NullType](./src/main/java/analysis/types/NullType.java)

For each class in the source program one object of **ReferenceType** is instantiated.
**The original here discusses the class types ...**

Arrays are a special case of a reference type. Each instance of **ArrayType** has an
element type of **ProperType**. The subtype relation is covariant to the element types
except for two special cases: **The original here discusses the usage of a super type for references; this is different for our portfolio!**


## Analysis
```java
MJFrontend frontend = new MJFrontend();
MJProgram program = frontend.parseString(input);
// [..]
Analysis analysis = new Analysis(program);
analysis.check();
```
We have a class [Analysis](./src/main/java/analysis/Analysis.java)
that takes the abstract syntax tree and performs analysis in the function `check()`.
Afterwards a list of errors can be retrieved by `analysis.getTypeErrors()`.
Analysing works in the following steps:

1. First, objects for each type in the program are instantiated.
2. Next, we check for signature compatibility of overwritten methods using **`ìsSubTypeOf()`**
on the return types and the parameters.
3. Finally, we check names and types in the code of each method.
For this step, we set up a symbol table with .... **The original goes into detail regarding the symbol table**. Then, we walk through the method's body
using the AST's visitors.
```fsharp
// overall pseudo code for Analysis.check()
instantiateAllTypes()
checkMethodSignatures()
for class in classes do
  for method in class.methods do
    recursivelyCheck(method.body)
```

### Symbol Table

The symbol table is implemented efficiently using a map from identifiers to
stacks of declarations and a stack of scopes. In both cases we use `ArrayDeque<>`
for the stacks. We differ between local declarations and field declarations
to correctly determine which name can be reused (see package `analysis.names`).

### Main Method

Since the main class and the main method are a special case in the grammar they are not
checked by our design above. Therefore, we need to check them separately with `Analysis.checkMain()`.
**The original here discusses the handling of the main class; this is different for our portfolio!**
